# BurgerParadise

This specific burger creation app is a full stack app that demonstrates the use of Handlebars, Express, Node, and MySql.
How it works:
A burger is on the left side card that gives the option to "Devour" the burger. When clicking the "Devour" button the burger's attribute of DEVOURED is changed from FALSE to TRUE and is moved then appended to the left side of the page which displays the list of displayed burgers. 
The center input field allows the user to create a new "burger" and upon creation an ID, burgerType, and devoured (set to a boolean default false) is created in the database. This way each burger that is made is automatically appended to the Devour Burger list. 
The right side card displays the previously Devoured burgers and adds new ones each time the button is clicked.
